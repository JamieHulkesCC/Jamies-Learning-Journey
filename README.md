I found a YouTube video by Brackeys (which is a very reputable channel which is focused directly on the unity engine). This video explains how to make a working save and load in a game which is something that I have never been able to impliment into my games,as I have never had the time learn how to intergrate the system with my code. So I want to use this video because it with give me the fundementals to this system and hopefully allow me to understand it enough to be concious of implimenting it when I start my next project so it will be easy to add.

I started working through the tutorial in class, however I did a minor set back where Brackeys was using a premade scene for the 'fake game' that this system would be applied to. So, to resolve this a I made a similar project myself which was relatively basic where it just allowed to to change the value of the data of both the 'level' and 'health' so that I had some data that I could save and then load. This tutorial continued to explain that this is one of the best save systems that you can get in Unity because it saves the files as binary. This is really import because it basically encrypts the values so they are really hard to alter which is essential considering the majority of the time the values that these files will be holding would durastically be able to manipulate game progess which as developers we want to restrict as much as possible.

I managed to get the complete tutorial finished within the lesson however I will have to go back through some of the parts where he goes over how the system works as some of it is quite hard to get a complete understanfing of straight away so hopefully knowing the theory behind the system as well as having this pracctical example that I have made will help me be able to explain the process in the format of a tutorial to gain a complete understanding for myself and be able to use it easily for my AGP.
