I found a YouTube video by Brackeys (which is a very reputable channel which is focused directly on the unity engine). This video explains how to make a working save and load in a game which is something that I have never been able to impliment into my games,as I have never had the time learn how to intergrate the system with my code. So I want to use this video because it with give me the fundementals to this system and hopefully allow me to understand it enough to be concious of implimenting it when I start my next project so it will be easy to add.
